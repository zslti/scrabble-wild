# ⁉️ How to play?

## 🚩 Objective

The objective of Scrabble is to score more points than your opponents by forming words on the game board using letter tiles.

In each turn, a player places one or more tiles on the board to form a new word.

Points are scored based on the letters used and the placement of words on the game board. Each letter tile has a value, and some squares on the game board offer bonuses for scoring.

## 🚔 Basic rules

Words must be formed horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.

Each new word must connect to an existing word on the game board.
